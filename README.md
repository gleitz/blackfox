### Desktop Wallpaper Project ###

The lovely folks over at [The Fox is Black](http://www.thefoxisblack.com/category/the-desktop-wallpaper-project/) have been releasing a treasure trove of awesome desktop designs as a part of the Desktop Wallpaper Project. I found the webpage to be a little slow to load and there is unfortunately no way to download all backgrounds as a bundle. I wrote this little script to grab all the background in 1400x900.

You can find the [entire dump at this link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i1kzcd9s3k5lr1r/fox_backgrounds.zip?dl=0).
